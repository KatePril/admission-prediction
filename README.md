## Problem
The admission process is equally important for both universities and applicants.
While universities aim to select the best students, applicants are eager to secure a spot in their dream college.

Universities need an unbiased tool to make the selection process more effective and fair,
while applicants can utilize this tool to estimate their chances of being accepted.

To address this problem, I have trained several classic machine learning models,
including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost,
and selected the model with the best performance.


## Data
I used [MBA Admission dataset, Class 2025](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/mba-admission-dataset), which can be downloaded directly from kaggle or , from kaggle for training the model.
